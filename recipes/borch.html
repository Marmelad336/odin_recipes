    <h1>Description</h1>

     <p><strong>Borscht</strong> is a cultural heritage of Ukraine, our pride and culinary symbol of our country. It is simply impossible to be indifferent to this thick, rich soup</p>
        <p></p>
     <p>There are many recipes for borscht and almost every housewife has her own. Someone likes borscht with beans, someone cooks it without cabbage, and someone cooks it with mushrooms. Quite often, borscht recipes in families are carefully passed down from generation to generation, and some are even kept in strict secrecy</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Water - 1.5-2 liters</li>
            <li>pork or beef on the bone – 400 g</li>
            <li>potatoes – 4 pcs. (medium)</li>
            <li>beets – 2 pcs. (small)</li>
            <li>carrots – 1 pc.</li>
            <li>onions – 3 pcs. (medium)</li>
            <li>fresh white cabbage – 300 g</li>
            <li>tomato paste – 2 tbsp.</li>
            <li>sunflower oil – 4-5 tbsp.</li>
            <li>citric acid – a pinch</li>
            <li>salt, bay leaf, herbs – to taste.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>First, cook the broth. Pour 1.5-2 liters of water into a saucepan. Add the meat and put on medium heat. Before boiling, remove the foam. As soon as the broth boils, cover with a lid and cook on low heat for an hour and a half</li>
            <li>In the meantime, prepare the roast. Peel the beets, carrots and onions. Grate the beets on a coarse grater, and the carrots on a medium grater. Cut the onion into cubes</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat, add the onions and carrots, fry for 5 minutes. Then add the beets (you can sprinkle them with citric acid or sprinkle with fresh lemon juice - this will make the borscht really red). Fry the vegetables for another 5 minutes, add the tomato paste, mix and fry for another 5-7 minutes</li>
            <li>Now let's cook the borscht itself. Remove the meat from the broth and, while it cools, throw the shredded cabbage into the broth. After 5-10 minutes, add the potatoes cut into strips. Separate the meat from the bone and cut into cubes. Return the meat to the borscht, salt it and add the seasoning. Stir the borscht, add the bay leaf and finely chopped herbs, cover and cook for another 5-7 minutes</li>
            <li>Serve the borscht with sour cream and herbs</li>
        </ol>
